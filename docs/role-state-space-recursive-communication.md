# Role State-Space and Recursive Communication Design

## 1. Purpose

This document describes how the current `roles`, `agents`, and `coordination` modules implement role-scoped communication based on state-space boundaries and recursive feedback loops.

多 Agent 协作的本质，不是消息传递，而是角色作用域状态空间之间，在约束下进行的递归状态变换与反馈控制。

The design follows these principles:

1. Role is prior to instance: role defines state-space boundaries, instance only executes transitions.
2. Memory is layered and scoped by role context rather than instance identity.
3. Communication is modeled as encoded state transitions.
4. Collaboration must define convergence conditions with explicit acceptance and verification signals.
5. Role-scoped workspace and conversation binding provides isolation and traceability.

## 2. Layered Memory Scope Strategy

To avoid over-constraining all memory into one key shape, memory scopes are split into three layers:

- `RoleWorkspaceMemoryScope(workspace_id, role_id)` for durable role-level memory.
- `RoleConversationMemoryScope(workspace_id, role_id, conversation_id)` for conversation-thread continuity.
- `RoleTaskMemoryScope(workspace_id, role_id, conversation_id, task_id)` for short-lived task scratchpad state.

This aligns with the workspace-memory layering documented in `docs/role-workspace-memory-design.md` and supports both reuse and isolation.

## 3. Module Responsibilities

### 3.1 `roles` module

- `RoleDefinition` is the stable contract of role identity and role-level capabilities.
- `role_id` is used as the authoritative identity for role-scoped state-space and memory ownership.

Reference:
- `src/agent_teams/roles/models.py`

### 3.2 `agents` module

- `AgentRuntimeRecord` and `SubAgentInstance` are execution carriers.
- They hold runtime bindings (`instance_id`, `workspace_id`, `conversation_id`) and execute state transitions under role boundaries.

Reference:
- `src/agent_teams/agents/models.py`

### 3.3 `coordination` module

`src/agent_teams/coordination/role_communication.py` provides concrete coordination capabilities:

- `RoleStateSpace` and `RoleStateTransition`: role-defined state-space boundary.
- `RoleInstanceExecution` and `execute_role_transition(...)`: instance execution inside role boundary.
- `RoleAgentBinding` and `bind_role_to_agent_instance(...)`: connect `RoleDefinition` with runtime agent records.
- `build_role_workspace_memory_scope_from_binding(...)`: build role-level durable memory scope.
- `build_memory_scope_from_binding(...)`: build conversation-level thread memory scope.
- `build_task_memory_scope_from_binding(...)`: build task-level scratchpad scope.
- `RoleCommunicationExchange`, `validate_role_communication(...)`, and `validate_exchange_binding(...)`: communication as transition payload and boundary validation.
- `FeedbackLoopSpec`, `FeedbackLoopEvaluation`, `evaluate_feedback_loop(...)`, and `evaluate_feedback_loop_recursively(...)`: convergence evaluation for iterative collaboration.

## 4. Runtime Flow

### Step 1: Role and instance binding

Use `bind_role_to_agent_instance(role_definition, agent_instance)` to build a strict runtime binding.

Contract:
- `agent_instance.role_id` must equal `role_definition.role_id`.

Output:
- `RoleAgentBinding(role_id, instance_id, workspace_id, conversation_id)`.

### Step 2: Build memory scope by memory type

- Role durable memory: `build_role_workspace_memory_scope_from_binding(binding)`.
- Conversation continuity: `build_memory_scope_from_binding(binding)`.
- Task scratchpad: `build_task_memory_scope_from_binding(binding, task_id)`.

### Step 3: Execute role transition

Use `execute_role_transition(role_state_space, execution)` before applying a transition.

Checks:
- instance role must match role state-space role.
- transition must be inside allowed role transitions.
- no-op transitions (`from_state == to_state`) are only accepted when the state exists inside the declared role state-space.

### Step 4: Validate communication exchange

When one role sends communication to another, represent the message as `RoleCommunicationExchange` with conversation scope.

Checks:
- exchange memory role must match receiver role.
- transition must be legal in receiver role state-space.
- receiver binding can be validated with `validate_exchange_binding(...)`.

### Step 5: Recursive feedback convergence

Use `evaluate_feedback_loop(...)` for one iteration and `evaluate_feedback_loop_recursively(...)` for iterative runs.

Convergence condition:
- all acceptance criteria and verification points are observed.

Stop condition:
- convergence reached, or
- iteration reaches `max_iterations`.

## 5. Engineering Constraints

- Keep role boundary checks in coordination layer, not in ad-hoc prompt text.
- Keep imports at module top-level for dependency visibility.
- Keep public coordination interfaces exported from `agent_teams.coordination.__init__`.
- Add unit tests that mirror coordination path in `tests/unit_tests/coordination/`.
